# Customer Churn Analysis - Telecom Industry

**Presented by:** Thota Vinod Kumar

->Project Objective:

To predict telecom customer churn and provide actionable insights to retain users in a highly competitive telecom environment.


->Tools & Technologies:

- Python (Scikit-learn, ELI5)
- SQLite (for data storage)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


->Project Features:

- Data Preprocessing
- Binary Classification (Churn Prediction)
- Model Explainability with ELI5
- Customer Segmentation:
  - At Risk
  - Loyal
  - Dormant

-> SQL-Based Analysis:

- Aggregated call duration and complaint history
- Analyzed recharge frequency patterns
- Identified churn patterns using SQL queries
- Segmented high-risk users with behavior flags

-> Machine Learning Model:

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Target Variable:** churn (Yes/No)
- **Training Features:** Tenure, usage, complaints, recharge patterns, etc.
- **Interpretability:** Used ELI5 for model explanation
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy Score, Confusion Matri

->Customer Segmentation"

- **At Risk:** High complaints, low recharge frequency
- **Loyal:** Long tenure, consistent activity, low churn probability
- **Dormant:** Low engagement, low complaints, moderate churn risk

->Final Recommendations:

- Focus on retaining high-value At-Risk customers
- Offer loyalty rewards to long-term users
- Launch re-engagement campaigns for Dormant customers
- Monitor recharge and complaint frequency closely
